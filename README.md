# TAU LaTeX Thesis Template

This is meant to be a minimalistic thesis template to Tampere University (TAU) theses and reports. The current template is made to match the Hervanta campus thesis writing guide as closely as possible.

If you're just getting started or want to know something spesific, I highly recommend you check out the wiki for this project: https://github.com/kulmajaba/tau-thesis-template/wiki

The main document `main.tex` is used by default. `main-min.tex` is a minimalistic document with just the bare essentials (add your own imports as you need them). You can delete the unused main document or keep it around as an example.

I sincerely hope you will find this template useful in completing your thesis project. The document is commented extensively to clarify what everything is doing and give you an idea of how to effectively modify it. Most of the magic happens in the class file, `tauthesis.cls`, which you are more than welcome to take a look at.

I wish you and your project the best of luck! If this template causes you trouble along the way or if you've any suggestions for improving it, please open an issue on GitHub: https://github.com/kulmajaba/tau-thesis-template
